Skeleton_Installer
==================

This is a skeleton install script that will setup a MySQL Database and easily allow the user to preconfigure global settings as well as update preconfigured settings and allow developers to easily add new ones. Designed to be integrated into any development project then modified slightly to make it a production ready settings manager.

TODO: Add functional code to /admin/settings.php
